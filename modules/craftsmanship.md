   <summary><b>History of Craftsmanship</b></summary><br/>

   With this topic, you'll learn about how craftsmanship has been applied across different trades, cultures, and periods in human history.

   #### Learning Outcomes
   * Summarize the history of craftsmanship

      <p>The guilds started as a way for merchants and artisans to protect their craft. They would form these guilds, with the intent of protecting their craft and ensuring that quality remained high. They were used almost as a secret society that monitored their members, in a way to ensure that there was a standard. The guilds were also used to keep out competition that did not either join the guild or receive permission from them first (and paid a fee). Some guilds received very young men who were brought in and taught the trade gradually over time.</p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEG_7IYRM_E&t=195s">functions and aims of the guilds </a>

   * Critique ancient craftsmanship patterns and describe some of their benefits and drawbacks

      <p><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Quality was monitored and ensured that everything produced met the same standard set by the guilds</li><li>The guilds provided a great support system for other members that sometimes went beyond the craft</li><li>The guilds increased economic tranquility within the community because they would strike deals with other crafts that stated a member would have to buy only certain types of material from certain members of the community</li><li>Members of the guilds did not have to often fear competition from non-members as the guild did not allow such activity without permission(and payment)</li><li>The apprenticeship programs allowed for easy training (and monitoring) to ensure that the craft of the trade was kept and that quality was ensured to meet the standard set by the guild</li><li>Because of the way the guilds ensured quality, they also were akin to garner a good reputation amongst the community it served within and some neighboring communities</li></ul></p>

      <p><h3>Drawbacks</h3><ul><li>While the guilds helped to ensure high quality of goods, the way they handled outside competition, it limited the progress of their craft. They would resist new ideas that disrupted their order of doing things</li><li>Most guilds had somewhat monopolistic approaches that can also be harmful to innovative ideas</li></ul></p>

   * Propose how craftsmanship might apply to modern society

      <p>I am breaking this question down into 2 parts. First will be observations in the Business world as a whole. Then, we will dive more into society roles.<ul><h3>Business</h3><li>Lots of companies now have enacted apprenticeship or "earn-as-you-learn" programs to teach new employees more about the craft of the business. This is done in a mutual way because the employee is gaining some financial compensation, as well as learning, while the company can get an employee at lower market value, while training them to master a specific task to better impact the business</li><li>The Shokunin, while not entirely the same, shares many similarities with the traditional assembly line. One individual becomes incredibly skilled at their one task, which is just a piece of the whole process</li></ul></p>

      <p><h3>Society</h3><ul><li>In regards with shokunin, society has parts that are constantly working on improvement and spending a lifetime trying to improve. People who workout and the Buddhist monks of sri lanka are 2 such examples. Bodybuilders spend many years of their life trying to constantly improve their physical being, while the monks spend a lifetime trying to achieve spiritual growth.</li><li>Some parts of society use craftsmanship as a way to maintain their culture, such as the native tribes of alaska. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/native-artisans-alaska-innovation-humor-craft-180976519/">Smithsonian Article</a></li><li>Some sanctions of The free masons still use many of the principles that were used by 13th century stonemason guilds.</li></ul></p>

   <summary><b>Principles of Modern Craftsmanship</b></summary><br/>

   With this topic, you'll learn about the principles of modern craftsmanship and how they can be utilized in any occupation.

   #### Learning Outcomes
   * List the principles of modern craftsmanship

      <p><ul><li>To have a deep passion for what you are creating, as the end user is not the creator itself but the customer</li><li>To embrace the suck. Working will have its painful moments, whether that is growing pains or pain for work that isn't thrilling.</li><li>Focus your success on everyday improvement. It is easy to judge success based on completion of projects, or things "outside the norm", but real success starts with the changing of the success mindset.</li><li>To have some originality in your craft and become a resource and inspiration to others.</li></ul></p>

   * Compare the craftsmanship mindset to the contemporary approach to work

      <p><ul><li>The contemporary mindset follows the pattern of one-way to do things, as to reach mass production. The craftsman mindset is using all the tools at the disposal to creatively engineer many ways of achieving the desired result.</li><li>The contemporary approach is also one in which things are produced with generally low product-life cycles, whereas a craftsman builds something with the intent that it will outlive the creator.</li><li>To reiterate, the contemporary approach is to produce in mass, as much as possible, with enough care to last around 3-5 years average. The craftsmanship mindset is different where the goal is to build something with passion to see it grow and endure longevity.</li></ul></p>

   * Explain what craftsmanship means to you and how you might apply it in your work

      <p><ul><li>Craftsmanship to me means having a "growth mindset". It means to take your passion and not just do the basic but always put your best in any project and build something that will outlive me.</li><li>It means developing a sort of perfectionism attitude that can only be truly achieved by being a valuable resource to others.</li></ul></p>

      <p><ul><li>Although I am quite new to the developer lifestyle, I can still find ways to apply it to there as well as other aspects of my life. </li></ul></p>
         <h3>Developer</h3>
            <p><ul><li>I can start to give my projects full attention and continue to build off old ones, with new things I've learned.</li><li>I can unlearn the contemporary mindset that has been instilled in me and begin progressing towards the craftsmanship mindset</li><li>I can reach out to community members and begin to spread the word of this program, and what craftsmanship is really about</li></ul></p>
         <h3>Other Aspects of Life</h3>
            <p><ul><li>I can give every passion that I have, all the attention to detail it is needed.</li><li>I can have a "growth mindset" in any endeavor I have, with the aim to make progress everyday, and eventually get to the point where I can teach others.</li></ul></p>

   * Theorize why the pursuit of craftsmanship leads to a higher quality of work

      <p><ul><li>I think the pursuit of craftsmanship leads to a higher quality of work because you are making an active choice to progress and perfect your craft everyday.</li><li>I think it can also be a signature of pride and become an embodiment of an individual. It eventually becomes a lifestyle, not just a mindset that you garner when you work, but something that you carry with you in your daily life.</li><li>When you develop a high passion to perfect something, you find an enjoyment in the process of it all, good and bad, not just the result. I think most can agree that happy workers tend to be more efficient, and will in turn lead to a higher quality of work.</li></ul></p>

      <h3>3 Trades and the effect of the craftsmanship mindset</h3>
      <p><ul><li>The first question asked is what mindset is required to find success. I think to go further into that, you must first define what success is. Success is usually thought of how much money you make or the prestige of your job. Meriam-Webster defines success as "the fact of getting or achieving wealth, respect, or fame". My personal definition of success is one in which an individual achieves their set goals and ultimately is happy. With this exercise, I hope to tackle the mindset question using both the Webster's definition and my own.</li></ul></p>
      <p><ol><li>Carpenter</li><p>Going by the Webster's definition, I think that you can succeed in this field using the contemporary mindset and I'll explain why. The way that the housing market has recently boomed, coupled with the lower work force of carpenters, many of them have a demand far greater than they can supply. A carpenter can do "enough" to get the projects built and up to code without having to worry about much competition, or their customers going elsewhere. They don't have a real need to continually improve their craft to achieve wealth, respect, or fame. Also you bring into account that if you are a carpenter who is not on the architectural or design team, rather you do the "grunt" work, you can further exacerbate this mindset because you can get in the contemporary mindset of "mass production" and "automation".</p><p>To achieve success as I have defined it, you would need the craftsmanship mindset and here is how the modern mindset can apply to carpenters. No matter the level you are (grunt work, design, foreman, etc.) you can apply various methods of the craftsmanship mindset to your craft. The process of perfecting your craft and setting small, progressive goals can lead you to happiness and success in the manner in which I defined it. If you develop the habits of building the best you can and using your craft to focus on what the customer wants/needs, you can apply the modern craftsmanship mindset to achieve success. With taking this approach, carpenters can reach that level of admiration from their peers and become a resource to others. They can separate themselves by making the way they achieve things original with their own touch.</p><li>Mechanic</li><p>While the trade market is generally low compared to demand, I think for a mechanic to achieve success (based on Webster's) a craftsmanship mindset is needed. Your clientele is built upon your reputation and word of mouth (usually for returning customers and sometimes new) and it is therefore very important to take passion and pride into your craft to deliver the best client results possible. When you take this approach, it is noticed by your customers and those around you. When you are considered unique and the best at your craft, you become a resource to others and pass your knowledge along.</p><p>To reach success based on my definition, a craftsmanship mindset is needed for much of the same reasons listed above. You will achieve true happiness by caring about your work, having a deep passion, and showing that in your craft.</p><li>Welding</li><p>Welding presents an interesting angle that differs slightly from the aforementioned trades because some welding is automated. We will go more in depth on the effects that has.</p><p>From the both Webster's & my own standpoint, I think that a craftsmanship mindset is needed to be successful. If you don't provide that mindset, you will become overtaken by your competition as it will show in your work. If you take the craftsmanship mindset, overlook some of the monotony the work has, and don't simply go through this "automation" motion, you will be happier and want to give more to your craft. Eventually you will be recognized by your work from your peers and your mindset can become infectious to those around you.</p><p>How does having automation affect the trade and the craftsmanship mindset? The answer? Not much. The machine is programmed by humans who can possess this mindset. The machine only does what the human tells it, it becomes an extension of the being. The machine is just a piece of the process that is used by the human to achieve the overall project and therefore is a part of the craft.</p><ol></p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4><p><ul><li>What surprised me about this exercise is how much the mindset impacts non-programmer roles.</li><li>This exercise stretched me because it furthered my understanding on the impact of craftsmanship with many other trades. It also helped me to understand that the craftsmanship mindset can still be achieved even in a heavily automated environment. The integration of machines doesn't really change the craftsmanship mindset, which was eye-opening.</li><li>My next step is to continue to embody the craftsmanship mindset in my code and other passions. No current resources can be provided at this time. I am reading pragmatic programmer which is helping to understand and further develop many of the principles that are shared with the craftsmanship mindset.</li></ul></p>

   <summary><b>The Software Craftsmanship Movement</b></summary><br/>

   With this topic, you'll learn about the software craftsmanship movement and how it can be applicable far into the future.

   #### Learning Outcomes
   * Describe the purpose of the software craftsmanship movement

      <p><ul><li>According to <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/software-craftsmanship/">Sandro Mancuso</a>, the movement is meant to bring back quality to software. Building software that is easily crafted, easy to revise, and is constantly providing value to its customers is the core of the movement that is achieved with the craftsmanship mindset. </li></ul></p>

   * Compare the software craftsmanship movement with the modern craftsmanship principles

      <p><ul><li>Both the software and modern craftsmanship have many similarities to no one's surprise. Both are really founded on bringing the best quality you can to your craft. They both emphasize constantly improving your craft and reaching out to communities of others to share the knowledge.</li></ul></p>

   * Propose how you might go about creating positive change in the software engineering community

      <p><ul><li>I can start by spreading the craftsmanship mindset with my school. At NSS, we aren't really taught in that way, probably due to the time constraint and how much there is to learn. But I could help by volunteering to speak at alumni events, mentoring current students and alumni, and passing around good resources to my fellow classmates that I am still in contact with.</li><li>I can also attend meetups and help spread the word. Nashville is a growing tech community and being involved with the Nashville community can give me access to reach out to others in this community and surrounding communities.</li></ul></p>

   <summary><b>Learning as an Apprentice</b></summary><br/>

   With this topic, you'll learn patterns and techniques to learn new topics and effectively build skills as an apprentice.

   #### Learning Outcomes
   * Describe the responsibilities of an apprentice during an apprenticeship

      <p><ul><li>The responsibilities of an apprentice is to learn the craft of the mentor, as they do it (Sha). Then they are to understand the "why" or the underlying methods of what they learned (Ha). Lastly, they are to use the knowledge gained from the first 2 steps to then innovate and create their own methods of the craft, to which someday, they can teach to another (Ri).</li></ul></p>

   * Evaluate your preferred learning style(s) using the theory of multiple intelligences

      <p><ul><li>Of the multiple intelligences, I feel that visual-spatial and intrapersonal are the 2 that best describe my learning.</li><li>Visual-spatial is an important component to my learning. I am able to netter grasp concepts when I can visually see them in action, along with asking questions to better understand. I see something done, and then have the desire to try it myself, asking questions along the way.</li><li>Intrapersonal is another preferred style of mine. I don't have many strengths in the coding world YET, but I have always been one to work on my weaknesses and make them a strength. It is a simply philosophy that I have incorporated in my personal life, specifically in athletics and working out. Its a sound principle that I use because I want to purposely be uncomfortable, so that I can grow.</li></ul></p>

   * Compare the apprenticeship learning model of shuhari to a traditional classroom model

      <p><ul><li>The model of shuhari differs a little bit from the traditional classroom model. The Shu is typical of most classroom learning settings. Students watch the master (teacher) and imitate them. They spend hours watching them or listening to powerpoints they present. Mathematics is a prime subject that represents Shu very well. Other conceptual subjects may be harder to "imitate" other than to absorb the information and regurgitate it.</li><li>The Ha falls into many of the same categories of the Shu. Assimilation is one that takes years to really master. It is the section where the deep understanding occurs and questions are being asked. This section of Shuhari further filters out many subjects that fall under the classroom model. Arithmetic such as those found in mathematics and physics can be found in the Ha section. Many subjects though will not reach this point as they are not taught for the reason of assimilation or integration, but rather taught to pass tests and show overall aptitude. Exceptions to this can be found in some targeted areas such as some college courses and bootcamps, but they may not follow the typical classroom models anyway.</li><li>The Ri part of Shuhari is not found in the typical classroom model. Innovating and making it your own is just not something that the classroom model incorporates, partly because most never reach the Ha level. This is what really separates the Shuhari learning model from the classroom model.</li></ul></p>

   * Define what success looks like for you at the end of your apprenticeship

      <p><ul><li>For me, if accepted, success would be one in which I experience growth, starting with adopting the craftsmanship mindset. I want to put full effort into bringing high quality into my craft, my code, my teamwork, and my life. I want to further solidify my understanding of the code and the foundations for several languages. I finally wish to grow my knowledge to the point where I can eventually become a mentor in my own right.</li></ul></p>

      <p><ul><li>What surprised me the most about this exercise was the need to publish what my goals are, so that they are now visible to the public and open to ridicule, as well as constructive criticism.</li><li>This exercise stretched me in the fact that I have gone public with my goals. Normally goals are thought of as internal steps that someone wishes to accomplish, so making them public puts me out of my comfort zone. I am also the type of individual who is generally very private, so that further puts me out of my comfort zone and is will hopefully make me more comfortable sharing in large groups.</li><li>Form here I wish to further push myself out of my comfort zone so that I can continue to grow.</li></ul></p>

   <summary><b>Coaching as a Mentor</b></summary><br/>

   With this topic, you'll learn about patterns and techniques to mentor an apprentice in their journey to graduation effectively.

   #### Learning Outcomes
   * Describe the responsibilities of a mentor during an apprenticeship

      <p><ul><li>The big responsibility of the mentor is to grow mutually alongside the individual(s) being mentored. The mentor shows the mentorees that being in the "stretch" zone is a constant thing and that its okay to make mistakes and take hits to your ego, as long as you are learning from them and continuing your own growth.</li></ul></p>

   * Compare the role of a mentor with the role of a teacher

      <p><ul><li>The role of a mentor is quite similar to a teacher a teacher with one big difference. Both a teacher and a mentor ares supposed to "teach" their subjects. The intent is to further the knowledge and growth of the subjects beyond their previous knowledge. Both will take similar steps in showing the way the mentor/teacher accomplishes their desired goal and then answering questions that may follow. The big differences in between a mentor and a teacher is how far the growth extends. A teacher teaches the material until the subjects become proficient enough to pass the tests and that is all. They do not further push the students and encourage more beyond the scope of the class. A mentor however, wants their subjects to constantly be in the "stretch" zone. They want to further their growth/education beyond the scope of a normal class and want to instill the value of "continual learning". A teacher is satisfied with their subjects being in the "comfort" zone, so long as they are proficient in class, whereas a mentor is not.</li></ul></p>

   * Define what success might look like for your mentor at the end of your apprenticeship

      <p><h5>Success for my mentor can will consist of:</h5><ul><li>First and foremost, success for my mentor will be accomplished if I, as an apprentice, reach what I have defined as success.</li><li>Success for my  mentor will be accomplished if they not only challenge me but I am able to challenge them, and keep them in a constant "stretch" zone.</li><li>If at the end of my apprenticeship, I am able to become a mentor in my own right.</li><li>Lastly, I think success will be achieved if both my mentor and I create a very synergetic work relationship so that we can further help the company and provide greater quality to our clients.</li></ul></p>
